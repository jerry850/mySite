  <p  class = "lists textFont textColor" >
I am of Scandinavian origin, hence the love of cold, snow and mountains. This kind of scenery will always have a special place in my heart. This is a picture of the "blue road" in Iceland.

    I had done some programming previously but never at such a sustained tempo as on the course. The enviroment was completely new to me, using Trello, Terminal, Github, VS Code and Slack, all on a Mac. They are very powerful used like this together.

       I decided to enroll with Codenation to see what it was like to program with other people. And I am happy to report it's more fun and you learn much, much more quickly than sitting alone in your bedroom!

        I have had many hobbies over the years including playing computer games, reading history and popular science books and playing tennis. My current hobby is learning Spanish.
