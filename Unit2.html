1.1  Give a description of the layout of each page. Each page starts at the top with a navigation bar which is left aligned 
and a title below
it which is centre aligned and has a shadow effect. The content in all pages uses the same layout. The layout consists of a number of paragraphs with opaque background
 with padding around them. Each paragraph
 contains a few sentences which are left aligned.    
  </p> 
  <p  class = "lists textFont textColor" >
     1.5  Describe the copyright and other restrictions on websites. Images used on websites may be subject to copyright
     and you may need to purchase them in order to display them on your website. 
     However websites built for educational purposes can ususally disregard this. Many websites have copyrighted their html 


     code and copying it may lead to intellectual property rights being infringed.
     </p>
     <p  class = "lists textFont textColor" >
        1.6  Describe access issues effecting disabled people that website designers need to take into account.
        For blind users having an audio version of the website can be helpful. For partially sighted or elderly
        users having a toggle button that enables the text size to increase by 200% 300% can be a very helpful feature.

            1.7  What are the appropriate file types for websites? The best file type for pictures are .jpg, .png, .gif and .svg.
             Jpg's are best for photos only. Png's support transparency but are not supported by some browsers. For content and styling
            we have to use .html and .css files. For interactive websites other file types for languages such 
            SQL, PHP and Javascript will be used.
