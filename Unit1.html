What is the purpose of IT in modern business? Rapid facilitation of communication between workers, managers and customers is very important in todays world. 
Businesses also use IT to automate tasks in order to save time. Data can also be stored securely and analysed accurately
 and rapidly using IT    
  </p> 
  <p  class = "lists textFont textColor" > 1.2
     What resources and skills do you need to implement digital projects? Well, the right mix of software, hardware and technical knowledge is vital.
      You may need to have a tech guru on hand in case you get stuck. Persistance, curiosity and  
      confidence are necessary for implementing most IT projects.  
     </p>
    <p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 1.3 How do we plan and build a website? Firstly, we need to create the html files 
      and put them in a folder.
      Then we need to create the html code for our web pages, 
      including an internal navigation system. Next, we need to style the website using CSS adding 
      backgrounds behind our text. Lastly we add 
      the content between the html tags. Trello is a useful tool to aid in keeping track of the many tasks. You can see my
      trello by clicking this link.<a href ="https://trello.com/b/U0OscEvb/mywebsite" >  my trello page</a>

    </p>
     <p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 1.4 What can cause IT projects to fail? Lack of communication between IT teams and businesses teams can cause IT 
       projects to fail. Overambitious projects are also more likely to fail. Failure to anticipate possible problems
       you will encounter using the new equipment/software, for example incompatibilty problems may also lead to failure.
        Another thing that can go wrong is the incorrect choice of "off the shelf" software instead of "bespoke" software and vici versa. </p>

<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 1.5 How should we select the right technology for a given business? Firstly, we need to 
  correctly ascertain what the business problems are we want the IT to fix. Alternatively, what processes and procedures
   could the IT make more efficient? Do we need bespoke or Off the shelf software? Is all the hardware necessary? do we really need powerful graphics cards for example 

</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 1.6How have Trello and Github help with building this website? Trello has helped by providing 
  easliy accessible to do lists, which is the basis of any serious planning. Github provides a safe repository for code 
in case anything goes wrong with your computer. Also, it allows others to correct and view your code, so you are alone!</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 1.7 How does GDPR effect digital projects? GDPR is legislation designed to protect how EU citizens data is used and provides re
  restrictions on how data can be used and shared. As this website is not interactive no user data will be stored and GDPR will
ill not be an issue. However websites that track users or store user input will need to make sure they abide by the legislation or face possible
prosecution.
</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 2.1 How did I find using VS studio and Trello on this project? It was nice to be able to have the html and CSS code on the same page.
  Trello was not necessary for this project but would be indispensible on a much larger one.
</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 2.2 Were VS studio and Trello appropriate for this project? Not really, but I can see for a larger one
  the time invested in learning them would pay off. 
</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 2.3 Am I happy with the project? Well, I would have liked do a header and footer and am still not really happy with
  the readabilty and fonts. The layout could certainly be improved. Would have been nice to use flex as it seems like a fantastic program.
</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"> 2.4 What further improvements could be made to this website? Well, the appearance of some navigation
   tools within pages would help 
  readabilty. Maybe some moving images or interactive features would improve things.
</p>

<p class = "lists textFont textColor" > 2.5 In this project did the outcome match the requirement? Yes, I think this website does what it is supposed to do.</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"  >3.1 What are the benefits and drawbacks of the tools and methods used in this project?  
It would have been quicker to work as a team and using an enviroment I was familiar with (i.e. Codepen) but I learnt much more this way.
</p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"  > 3.2 In what way could we improve productivity in this project? By using Flex. An initial 
  investment in time to master it would be the only drawback to using it  </p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"  >3.3 What would improve productivity in this project? Delegating different jobs to
  different people would have speeded it up. One person could have done research and content, someone else could have done the layout. </p>
<p class = "lists textFont textColor"  > 3.4 How would you go about testing digital projects? This website would needed to be tested on different
   browsers. An interactive website would require special sofware to test the back end and front end of the project </p>
